Responsive Landing Page
## Interactive Navigation Menu

### Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navigation menu is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with features that enhance the user experience through interactivity and responsiveness.

### Features
- **Fixed Position Navigation:** The navigation menu remains fixed at the top of the page, ensuring it is always visible as users scroll through the content.
- **Scroll-Responsive Styling:** The menu dynamically changes its background color when the page is scrolled, providing a visual cue to users about their position on the page.
- **Hover Effects:** Each menu item changes its style when hovered over, enhancing the interactivity and engagement of the navigation experience.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structures the navigation menu and the overall layout.
- **CSS:** Styles the navigation menu, including fixed positioning, background colors, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity by changing the background color and font color based on scrolling and hover actions.

### How It Works
1. **HTML Structure:** The HTML file includes a `<nav>` element containing the menu items. This structure ensures semantic correctness and accessibility.
2. **CSS Styling:** The CSS file defines the styles for the navigation menu, including its fixed position, background colors, and hover effects for menu items.
3. **JavaScript Interactivity:** The JavaScript file listens for scroll events and hover actions, dynamically updating the styles of the navigation menu and its items to reflect user interactions.
